# Events (2021)

> TBA, we're still figuring out how to incorporate wasps into our activities

Check out [2019's schedule]({{'/assets/WPAFW2019EventSched.pdf' | absolute_url}}) to see what shenanigans we usually get up to:

<div class="columns is-mobile is-centered">
<div class="column is-three-quarters">
<embed id="content" src="{{'/assets/WPAFW2019EventSched.pdf' | absolute_url}}" width="100%"/>
</div>
</div>

Schedule changes and updates will be posted to the WPAFW Events Telegram Channel @ [t.me/wpafwofficial](https://t.me/wpafwofficial).

We hope to see you there!
