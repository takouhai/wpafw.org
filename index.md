Every year, WPAFW chooses a local animal rescue/rehabilitation charity to support with our famed charity raffle. Previous charities include [Going Home Greyhounds, Inc](https://www.goinghomegreyhounds.org/) in Wexford, [Hide-E-Hole Ferret Rescue](https://hide-e-hole.com/) in Mt. Oliver, [Clarion PAWS](http://www.clarionpaws.org/) in Clarion, [White Oak Animal Safe Haven](https://whiteoakanimalsafehaven.com/) in White Oak, and [The Awesome Spirit of Wildlife](https://tasow.org)!

We'll be selecting this year's charity soon, so keep an eye out on [our social media channels](http://wpafw.org/contact#social-media)!
