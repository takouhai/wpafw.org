## WPAFW 2020 Cancellation

Please see the below letter from P.A.W. and WPAFW regarding the cancellation of WPAFW 2020.

Stay tuned for more information on other events that may be planned in the event's stead as well as dates for 2021!

> # Western PA Furry Weekend (W.P.A.F.W) & Pennsylvania Anthropomorphics West (P.A.W.)
> 
> **June 8, 2020**
>
> To All our Attendees and Patrons,
>
> As we navigate this difficult and confusing time around COVID-19, we are faced with some challenging decisions surrounding the safety and overall feasibility of running events. We’re all aware of the many cancellations that events have had to endure, and WPAFW is not immune to similar considerations.
>
> Unfortunately, due to the nature and uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, the directors of WPAFW and board of PAW have decided to cancel WPAFW for 2020.
>
> We are acutely aware of the excitement and overall hope that WPAFW would have been held this year and we are disappointed that it’s come to having to make this decision and we apologize to all of you who were planning on coming.
>
> The decision was not made in haste, but there were some major considerations we had to take into account:
>
> * Due to our layout and the form of the event, we are heavily focused on the camaraderie and closeness of all of our attendees for the duration of the event.
> * Food prep and distribution would have had a major challenge in protecting staff as well as attendees and the risk was far and above acceptable levels.
> * The inclusion of alcohol in the event itself eases people’s inhibitions and could lead to safety concerns.
> While these are not exhaustive reasons, we were sure to listen to all of our staff and their concerns. We do not take this decision lightly as this has a major effect on all who are part of our event. This includes our charity, our featured artist, all staff, and all attendees.
>
> We do, however, look forward to bringing our best for WPAFW 2021 and look forward to seeing you there!
> 
> In addition, we are presently working on possible stand-in experiences and events for this year so please keep an eye out for announcements!
>
> We miss you, and we hope you miss us. We will see you soon.
>
> **Justin L. (Manick)**<br>
> **Treasurer of P.A.W. and Chairman of WPAFW**
>
> **Ben C. (Blithe)**<br>
> **Chairman of P.A.W. and Logistics Director of WPAFW**
>
> **Fisher C. (Oz)**<br>
> **Secretary of P.A.W. and Hospitality Co-Director of WPAFW**
