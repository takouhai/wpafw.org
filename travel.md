# Getting to WPAFW

North Park Lodge is a rustic venue in the heart of North Park, north of Pittsburgh, PA. This large and spacious lodge features an open-ceiling great room and two large satellite rooms on the main floor, as well as a dining room and bar on the lower level. There is also a large patio accessible from the dining room and even an outdoor stage!

## Shuttle Service

As some of you may recall, WPAFW 2018 had a shuttle service between North Park Lodge and the Home2 Suites. We are pleased to announce that we will again have this shuttle available for our attendees!

Being that WPAFW will be serving beer on-site, this shuttle is available for folks who will be enjoying frothy brews but do not have a safe ride available back to the hotel. Shuttle runs will be limited and available on a first-come-first-serve basis and we will update with more information closer to the con!
