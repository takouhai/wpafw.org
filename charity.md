# Charities

Every year, WPAFW chooses a local animal rescue/rehabilitation charity to support with our famed charity raffle. Previous charities include [Going Home Greyhounds, Inc](https://www.goinghomegreyhounds.org/) in Wexford, [Hide-E-Hole Ferret Rescue](https://hide-e-hole.com/) in Mt. Oliver and [Clarion PAWS](http://www.clarionpaws.org/) in Clarion. 

## This year we're featuring **[The Awesome Spirit of Wildlife](https://tasow.org)** as our charity!

"Our mission is to help communities create a sustainable future for all living things through education, biodiversity preservation, and a culture of appreciation for the natural world."
